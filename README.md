# CadiaDB

📚 Naive In-Memory Database with File-Based Persistence & Real-Time Changefeeds 🌐


## TODO
![chamber of understanding](https://i.imgur.com/sVtZKfo.gif)

1. **Persistence**:
    - we going file-based cause i have no idea what i am doing.

2. **Concurrency**:
    - the current implementation uses `sync.RWMutex` for concurrency control. is this the best? no idea yet.

3. **Advanced Query Capabilities**:
    - i have zero idea how this will look just yet. 

4. **Changefeed Mechanism**:
    - implement a changefeed system similar to RethinkDB that notifies clients in real-time when data changes.

5. **Indexing**:
    - adding indexing of some sort.

6. **Scalability**:
    - idk just yet

7. **Unit Tests**:
    - lol
